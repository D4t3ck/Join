## What is Join?

**Join** is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the **Developer Akademie**. 

Kanban, a Japanese term meaning *"billboard"*, is a highly effective method to:
- Visualize work
- Limit work-in-progress
- Maximize efficiency (or flow)

Join leverages kanban principles to help users manage their tasks and projects through an intuitive, visual interface. 

> **Note:** Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality.

## How to Use Join

Follow these steps to get started with Join:

### 1. Exploring the Board

When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists:
- **To Do**
- **In Progress**
- **Await Feedback**
- **Done**

### 2. Creating Contacts

Collaborate with your team by adding contacts:
1. Navigate to the **Contacts** section.
2. Click on **New contact**.
3. Fill in the required information.

Once added, these contacts can be assigned to tasks and interact with the tasks on the board.

### 3. Adding Cards

Cards represent individual tasks within your project. To add a new card:
1. Click the **`+`** button under the appropriate list.
2. Fill in the task details, such as:
   - Task Name
   - Description
   - Due Date
   - Assignees, etc.

### 4. Moving Cards

As tasks progress through different stages, reflect their status on the board:
- Drag and drop the card from one list to another.

### 5. Deleting Cards

Once a task is completed, you can:
- Move it to the **Done** list, or
- Permanently delete the card.

> **Warning:** Deleting a card is irreversible. Please exercise caution when performing this action.
