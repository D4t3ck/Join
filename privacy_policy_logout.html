            For registration on our website, we require some personal data that
            is transmitted to us via an input mask.

            services on our website.
          </p>
          <h3>Legal basis:</h3>
          <p>
            The processing of the data entered during registration is based on
            the user's consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR).
          </p>
          <h3>Recipients:</h3>
          <p>
            Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as

          </p>

          <h3>Storage period:</h3>
          <p>
            Data will only be processed in this context for as long as the
            respective consent is available.
          </p>
          <h3>Provision prescribed or required:</h3>
          <p>
            The provision of your personal data is voluntary, based solely on

          <h2>Information about your right to object under Art. 21 GDPR</h2>
          <h3>Case-specific right to object</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from
            your particular situation, to the processing of personal data
            concerning you under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (data processing
            based on a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling
            based on this provision within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 4 GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless
            we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that
            outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing
            serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims.
          </p>
